# Simple Pointer Modification Bug in C
This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates a common error related to pointer usage. The program intends to modify the value of a variable using a pointer, but it might not work as expected due to improper understanding of pointers. 
The `bug.c` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.c` file presents a corrected version.
The focus here is on illustrating how seemingly simple pointer manipulation can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for writing robust and reliable C code.
